        Nowadays, it's easier than ever to make your ideas physically real. All you need
        is to design a 3D model to feed into a 3D printer. But if mainstream CAD 
        software seems hard to learn and too expensive, then it's time to learn from 
        _Designing with OpenSCAD_.

        New technologies allow us to do things we weren't able to do before easier,
        cheaper, and faster. Inevitably, they allow us to bend the world to our
        voice, our vision, and our will. What are the things we can do 
        with 3D printing that people don't want us to do?

      What is OpenSCAD?

      OpenSCAD is a free and simple programming language

      Combine 3D shapes.
    :markdown
      OpenSCAD is a declarative programming language. That means you describe _what_
      to build, rather than _how_ to build it.

      OpenSCAD creates models with no holes, so it's readable by 3D printers without
      any need to fix the 3D models--simplifying your toolchain.

      There are only 10 modules to learn in order to be dangerous in OpenSCAD. 
      That makes it easy to get started without learning a complicated interface.

      %i.fa.fa-code-fork

      Unlike mainstream CAD program files, OpenSCAD is code, and we can collectively
      build upon previous designs by leveraging git and other modern tools
      to collaborate.

      You can build parametric models with OpenSCAD, so if a dimension changes, you
      don't have to redesign the entire part. Just change a variable, and you're done.

        The things you see around you in your daily life was thought

        Once you realize that, it's a short leap to think of ways to change the
        things in your immediate surroundings.
